after making changes to a driver; it is convenient to compile the driver
only instead of instead of a complete kernel build

after building the module, it can be **reloaded**.

# targated compilation

to compile a single source file
```
make /path/to/object/file.o
```

to compile a directory
```
make path/to/directory
```

# compile as a module

example of compiling vimrc module

```
make M=drivers/media/test-drivers/vimc
```

you need to figure out dependencies for a module/driver/configuration
option, until all dependencies are enabled, The driver you are looking
ot enable will not be enabled.

Lets figure out dependencies of `vimc`:
vimc can be enabled by changing the `CONFIG_VIDEO_VIMC` option. Also it
is a tristate driver, which means it has options y,n,m for kconfig

It depends on `CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV`, `CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2`, and `CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API` to be enabled. It will also autoselect `CONFIG_VIDEOBUF2_VMALLOC` and `CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2_TPG`.

some options are boolean; which means they can either be enabled or
disabled.

use `make menuconfig`. to tweak config
