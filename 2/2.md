# basic survival skills

- these are basic git skills for survival
    - get commit history
    - working with remotes
    - creating branches
    - creating tags
    - rebasing tagged version
- provided in first 3 chapters of [_git book_](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

---

- developers send changes, **through email as patches**, so patches are essentially emails,
- patches are **small incremental changes** made to the kernel
- a patch cannot break the kernel
- requiring each patch to do one thing helps isolate regression
- reverting a problem patch becomes easier as well
- complex changes are thus split into smaller chunks


# whats in a ptch

- command to generate patch

```bash
git format-patch -1 --pretty=full 3a38e87... 
```

# patch components

1. commit id: hash of {commmit date, commiter name, commiter's email etc.}
2. **commit header**: follows the format:
```bash
major_subsystem:minor_area:short_description_of_what_is_being_changed
```    
There is another varient, using (`/`) instead of (`:`), convention is set by maintainer

---

3. **commit log**: is a **detailed description** of the change and **why it is required**, and if **testing is done**
4. author: can be specified in `git commit` or `.gitconfig` file

---

5. Commiter's name and email: 
    - The committer is a maintainer or developer that applies the patch to a git repository. 
    - This patch was picked up by the USB maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman and committed to the usb tree and tested prior to being included in a pull request from Greg KH to Linus Torvalds. 
    - Since it was pulled, you won't see Linus as the committer for this patch. If you look at the git log, you will see several merge commits from Linus for when he pulls subsystem trees from maintainers.
6. sign-off: just a line you add; here's the [_doc_](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#sign-your-work-the-developer-s-certificate-of-origin)

and others

# Tags

---

- patch version history:
    - When sending **reworked patch**, include version history
    - "what changed" between current and previous version of patch is
      added between `---` and start of diff in patch file
    - **any text added here (between - - - and start of diff) is not included in commit and will not be added to kernel when patch is applied**
    - include information helpful for reviewers here
    - an [_example patch_](https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11163415/)
- do not send new version of a patch as a reply to previous version,
start a new thread for each version of the patch

THANK YOU
