# intro

- you need `3 GB` of disk space in `boot` partition, to boot the kernel
- you can use Gpartition for that

# emails

- generate patch with `git format-patch` command
- send patch with `git send-email my_patch.patch`

> Thats all you do

# Cool stuff now

- be in /linux\_work
- clone the mainline
```
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux_mainline
```
- note that changing the protocol makes clone much slower
- you can use [_cregit_](https://cregit.linuxsources.org/) to view kernel sources

- Take a look at the Makefile and MAINTAINERS files in the main directory and scripts/get_maintainer.pl and scripts/checkpatch.pl. You will be using them in your everyday kernel development life.
