## Basic Info

- small incremental changes that add new features, make enhancement, fix bugs; are called **patches**
- new release in 2+ months
- new development and current release integration cycles run in parallel

# Kernel release process
- lets call general updates made available to the public as launches
    - using this defination there are 2 types of launches
    - there is a **2 week merge window**, in which new features are accepted
- A major launch with **new features and fixes** is called a release
    - this is called **rc1**
- minor launches with **bug fixes only** called release candidates
    - once a launch is out in the public, it unravels bugs and security issues
    - these bugs/vulnerabilities are fixed with patches, and these paches are accumulated for a week and launched as minor launches; which is named like **rc2, rc3, rc4 ...**

---

- usually the process of sending and including patches goes on upto **rc7, rc8**. Subject to weather **the code is good enough**?
- After that a 3 week quiet period starts. In this time, the maintainers prepare their trees, to send a pull request to linus
- After this 3 week period, the next merge window starts, in this merge window developers send their trees to linux via **signed pull**

# Kernel release process

![Release Process in the linux kernel](https://d36ai2hkxl16us.cloudfront.net/course-uploads/e0df7fbf-a057-42af-8a1f-590912be5460/03bno4kvu510-LinuxDevelopmentCycle.jpg){ height=75% }


# definations

- **release candidate/RC** releases are mainline kernel pre-releases that are used for testing new features in the mainline. These releases must be compiled from source. Kernel developers test these releases for bugs and regressions
- **stable releases** are bug fix only releases. 
    - After a mainline kernel is released it moves into stable mode
    - bug fixes to stable kernel are backported _from mainline to stable_ by designated stable kernel release maintainer
    - stable kernel release updates are released on average once a week(rc story)

- **long-term** releases are stable releases selected for long term maintenance
    - provide critical bug fixes to older kernel trees

- [docs](https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html)

# kernel trees 

- the kernel code is organised in several **main** and **subsystem repositories** called trees

- 
    1. **mainline kernel tree**: This is where linux releases mainline kernels and RC releases
    2. **stable tree**: this tree is maintained by greg kroah hartman. The tree consists of stable release branches, stable releases are based on this tree
    3. **linux-next**: this is the **integration** tree. code from large number of **subsystems trees** get pulled into this tree periodically, and then released for integration testing. This process of pulling changes from various trees catches merge conflicts between trees

---

- each subsysystem has its own tree and a maintainer(s), can find them [_here_](https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/MAINTAINERS)
- each subsystem has a mailing [_list_](https://lore.kernel.org/lists.html)
- development happens over mailing list:
    - contributors send patches to mailing list through emails and then they are discussed in mails
    - Once applied; a message is recieved "Thanks Applied"
    - [_doc_](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/development-process.html)
